PRISMA
======

Protocol Inspection and State Machine Analysis

The package PRISMA is hosted on CRAN, so

    install.packages("PRISMA")
    library(PRISMA)
    example(PRISMA)
    vignette("PRISMA")
	
will give you a first impression.

If you're on Centos Linux, install R first;

    sudo yum install R
